# Population VS Sample Data

1. Not all the bulbs have the same longevity and power consumption -> they have some __*variation*__ (__standard deviation__) in both longevity and power consumption.
2. How do you test the whole *population* of bulbs wheter they conform to industry standard? You need *sample* of the *entire* population.

1. If you collect data on the WHOLE populatoin, it's called *census*.

1. Sample must be "__well-chosen__". But how?
2. Sample should be "__independent__" of each other.
3. Random sample is mostly used.

* You can't include 'men', 'women from other countries', 'older than 35 or younger than 18 female'.
* If half of you sample is NBA female, then they do not representn the whole population (NBA players are much taller than average).
* Like friend chooses friends to form a sample group (as they are like-minded).
* Say you call landline to collect interview data, but people mostly use mobile now. So people you got from landline interview does not necessarily represent the whole population.

![Slide 6](assets/slide6.png)
A *sample* is an __approximation__ of the *population*.
* so always uncentainty attached to that approximation.

# Measure of Varibility:
## Variance & Standard Deviation
##### When you take sample out of the whole population, you will have errors or uncertainty => *variability*
We'll measure it -> variance & SD.

![Slide 9](assets/slide9.png)
* Same *__mean__* doesn't tell anythin.
* Look at how data points show **spread** (or *distribution* or *variability*)
* Both classes have the same *mean* but Class1 has greater *variability* (or more spread out).
* Students in Class2 are more consistent to the scores (closer to the *mean*).

![Slide 10](assets/slide10.png)
* Variance & SD help us answer -> how far datapoints are from the mean.
* Variance & SD are lower if spread less (see green stars vs blue stars above).
* Mean, Variance, SD should be used to compare against each other or against theoretical values.
