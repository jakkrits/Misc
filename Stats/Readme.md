## Population VS Sample Data
![Slide](assets/Slide1.png)

1. Not all the bulbs have the same longevity and power consumption -> they have some __*variation*__ (__standard deviation__) in both longevity and power consumption.
2. How do you test the whole *population* of bulbs wheter they conform to industry standard? You need *sample* of the *entire* population.

1. If you collect data on the WHOLE populatoin, it's called *census*.

1. Sample must be "__well-chosen__". But how?
2. Sample should be "__independent__" of each other.
3. Random sample is mostly used.

* You can't include 'men', 'women from other countries', 'older than 35 or younger than 18 female'.
* If half of you sample is NBA female, then they do not representn the whole population (NBA players are much taller than average).
* Like friend chooses friends to form a sample group (as they are like-minded).
* Say you call landline to collect interview data, but people mostly use mobile now. So people you got from landline interview does not necessarily represent the whole population.

A *sample* is an __approximation__ of the *population*.
* so always uncentainty attached to that approximation.
